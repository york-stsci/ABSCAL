# Configuration file for setting up the STENV environment with local additions.
#
# Written by: Brian York <york@stsci.edu>
# Written for: ABSCAL project
#
# This configuration is intended to be used with the "stenv_setup.py" python script. That
# script, in turn, is intended to do the following:
#
#   - Setup a conda environment based on STENV, using the most recent release tag
#   - Modify that environment based on a local environment.yml file
#   - Set up environment variables for use when the environment is activated
#
# The environment variables are specifically added to the 
#
#   $CONDA_DIR/envs/ENV_NAME/etc/conda/activate.d/activate.sh
#   $CONDA_DIR/envs/ENV_NAME/etc/conda/deactivate.d/deactivate.sh
#
# files.
#
# For the moment, the values in this file are trying to be self-documenting.

# For ABSCAL, there are a few additional notes.
#   - ABSCAL is intended to support IDL as well as python, so a lot of things are added
#     to the $IDL_PATH environment variable.
#   - ABSCAL may be installed either as editable or not, and the IDL code included has
#     been folded in to the ABSCAL python package, so a lot of IDL variables are pointing
#     in to the python package, wherever it's installed.

# Configuration of STENV and the local environment

# Configuration of environment variables
#
# Note that the "special" environment variables are always set up before the more general
# list, so by the time you're adding in the general list, you already have access to all
# of the special variable names.
env:
    # This contains environment variables that need special processing of one sort or 
    # another.
    special:
        # Including "package" means that an environment variable will be set up to point
        # to the installation location of the python package itself. The variable will be 
        # named "<NAME>_PKG" where <NAME> is the name in "base:name:" above. If you want 
        # to use this, your local environment file should install itself (i.e. in 
        # 'pip dependencies' include either "- ." or "- -e .")
        - package
    # This is the list of environment variables to set. Order can matter here in the 
    # sense that variables will be added to the setup file in order, so a later variable
    # can refer to a previous variable.
    vars:
        - CRDS_PATH: "${HOME}/crds_cache/"          # Local CRDS cache
        - oref: "${CRDS_PATH}/references/hst/oref/" # STIS data location
        - WFCREF: "${abscal_PKG}/wfc3/data/WFCREF"  # WFC3 reference data for IDL
