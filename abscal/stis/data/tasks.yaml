# Parameter values and settings for the STIS reduction tasks
#
# Parameters should have five keys:
#   - type: string/float/bool/int/etc.
#   - value: initialization value
#   - date: either "N/A" for the initial default value, or the last change date
#   - reason: either "initial" for the initial default value, or the reason for the last
#             change
#   - history: list of dictionary entries, each with:
#       - value: value at that point
#       - date: date the value was set to "value"
#       - reason: reason applied to the change
