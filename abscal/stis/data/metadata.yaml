# This file contains table metadata edits for STIS.
#
# Currently supported metadata changes are:
#   - edit: change the value of a table column for a specific exposure or exposures
#   - delete: set the "use" flag to False for a specific exposure or exposures. Does not
#             actually remove them from the table, but they will not be used for any 
#             part of the reduction.
#
# Individual entries have the form:
#
#   - type: node
#     column: <column>
#     key: <value>
#     [operation: <operation>]
#     [value: value]
#     reason: <reason>
#     source: source
#
# Where "column" specifies the column to look at in the table, "key" specifies the value 
# or values to look for, reason is a string where you should provide the reason that the 
# edit is needed, and source is a string specifying where the edit came from (if it came 
# from one of Ralph's IDL files). Source should be set to N/A if there isn't such a source 
# specified.
#
# It's also possible to build compound expressions from entries, and in that case the form
# will be:
#
#   - type: <operation>
#     [reason: <reason>]
#     [source: <source>]
#     entries:
#     - e1
#     - ...
#     - eN
#
# Where "operation" is one of AND, OR, or NOT, and the "entries" list holds a list all of
# whose elements are either node entries (above) or other compound entries. The reason and
# source entries are the same as in a node, and will be applied to all entries within the
# compound expression.
#
# The "operation" and "value" keywords are only used for edits. "operation" specifies 
# what the edit should be (currently one of "replace" or "append"), and "value" is either
# a string of the form "old->new" (where "old" and "new" are the current value and the 
# desired value respectively), or a string containing the value to append to each matching 
# entry.
